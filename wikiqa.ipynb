      "A cash crop also called profit crop is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit It is typically purchased by parties separate from a farm The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from staple crop subsistence crop in subsistence agriculture which are those fed to the producers own livestock or grown as food for the producers familyIn earlier times cash crops were usually only a small but vital part of a farms total yield while today especially in developed countries and among smallholders almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue In the least developed countries cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations and hence have some export valuePrices for major cash crops are set in international trade markets with global scope with some local variation termed as basis based on freight costs and local supply and demand balance A consequence of this is that a nation region or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper crop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets This system has been criticized by traditional farmers Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations A crop is a plant that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence  In other words a crop is a plant or plant product that is grown for a specific purpose such as food fibre or fuel When plants of the same species are cultivated in rows or other systematic arrangements it is called crop field or crop cultivationMost crops are harvested as food for humans or fodder for livestockImportant nonfood crops include horticulture floriculture and industrial crops Horticulture crops include plants used for other crops eg fruit trees Floriculture crops include bedding plants houseplants flowering garden and pot plants cut cultivated greens and cut flowers Industrial crops are produced for clothing fiber crops eg cotton biofuel energy crops algae fuel or medicine medicinal plants Presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on Earths climate Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to Earths climate The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution Fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere Carbon dioxide the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming has grown by about 50 and is at levels not seen for millions of yearsClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment Deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes Rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries These include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level riseClimate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss Human migration and conflict can also be a result The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate changeMany climate change impacts have been felt in recent years with 2023 the warmest on record at 148 C 266 F since regular tracking began in 1850 Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet Under the 2015 Paris Agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 C However with pledges made under the Agreement global warming would still reach about 28 C 50 F by the end of the century Limiting warming to 15 C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving netzero emissions by 2050Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution These energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil\n",
